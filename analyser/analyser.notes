analyser.py was adjusted according to the value found in the results.doc to find the average return for a number of given games, printing each games own return and averaging them(instead of single games this could be hundred ./sim.cpp 100 or a thousand ./sim.cpp 1000 results)
According to the 100_100 dataset the avg return was 90.97
According to the 1000_100 dataset the avg return was 91.65
According to the 1000_1000 dataset the avg return was 94.08
According to the 10000_1000 dataset the avg return was 94.09

From these results it can be concluded that as the number of games increases and takes luck out of the picture the return value approaches the intended value 94.
